### Welcome

The blog was named **VBA Lives** because ever year, for the last 10 years, I read imminent articles that VBA is going to die.  That Microsoft is going to abandon Visual Basic for something else. Yet 10 years later, VBA is alive and well.  VBA Lives is dedicated to you getting the most out of your Microsoft Applications and to help improve your job perfomance with the help of a little code.
