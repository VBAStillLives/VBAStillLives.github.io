### Access for Business Users

Microsoft Access is a desktop database tool.  **The program is a good one and is as underrated as it is overlooked by most users.**  You can create your own desktop database applications.  An example of a database application would be an inventory tracking system where you have forms that allow you to read or edit the information you need, and data tables to store them.  Where Excel has worksheets, Access has tables.  And where Excel has formulas and functions, Access has a graphical SQL query generator where users can simply point and click to create powerful queries without knowing to learn SQL.  


As a side note, I often think that Excel is misused as a data storage and data synthesis tool.  Excel what people know and are comfortable with.  I'll very frequently see people maninpulating a very large data set using many combinations of filters, formulas, and conditions to get at the data they actually need.  Over time, data synthesis processes become overly convoluted and complex.  What takes half a day with 50 filters, checks, and re-checks in Excel, can take less than five minutes in Access.  Always remember that Excel is primarily a calculation and modeling tool.  Access is better suited for storing large data sets and synthesizing them into more manageable pieces for analysis.  For this reason, Access and Excel work very well together.  You can store and breakdown large datasets in Access, then analyze the resulting data in Excel.  Access and Excel are a match made in heaven. 

### Access for Developers

I think Microsoft Access is overlooked and under appreciated by professional software developers too.  Often times Corporate IT will be focused SQL Server and Oracle and may push for the user-facing solution to be built in .C# or python.  The reality is that those solutions take time to develop.  Way longer than people in finance or marketing usually have.  Why not keep the SQL back-end and use Access as a front end?  This way you'd get rapid prototyping with a working proof of concept that gives business users short-term value and provides you with a blueprint to build a more robust tool with.
