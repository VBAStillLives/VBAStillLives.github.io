### About this Blog 

The blog was named **VBA Lives** because ever year I read imminent articles that VBA is going to die. Yet 10 years later, VBA is still here.  **VBA Lives is dedicated to you getting the most out of your Microsoft Applications and to help improve your job perfomance with the help of a little code.**  

There was a time in my life where I couldn't read or write a single bit of code.  I'd look at an integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor and not understand a single line of code.  **So this blog is very much written for the non-programmer.**  People in marketing, finance, sales, EAs, and small business owners will find value in this blog.  The only requirement is that you have basic familiarity with Excel.  The Access tutorial will start from scratch, so you can come into that with no experience at all. 

The tutorials are meant to provide a basic, logically ordered, and broad overview of VBA.  You won't become an overnight expert.  The goal is to give you the necesary knowledge upon which you can continue learning and growing in your code literacy, and hopefully gain productivity in your job.  



### About Me

My name is Sevan Serafino, and I started off as management consultant that accidentally turned technologist in 2011.  Need is the mother of innovation, and this perfectly describes the beginning of my journey with VBA.  I'd spend hours doing repetitive tasks in Excel to simply assemble my data before actually getting to the analysis that was the core accountability of my job.  VBA helped all that.  I started with a few snippets I found online at first (thank you [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)).  Around this same time, I had the opportunity to learn the more advanced capabilities of VBA from a consulting vendor I worked with.  I was hooked from there, and the rest is history.  I've been employed as a business-facing developer creating and tracking KPIs, dashboards, and automation tools for operations, B2B sales, finance, and analytics teams ever since.  

When I'm not coding VBA or doing data analysis, I'm a proud dad, ocean addict, amateur chef, and professional Netflix binge watcher.
