### About this Blog 

The blog was named **VBA Lives** because ever year I read imminent articles that VBA is going to die. Yet 10 years later, VBA is still here.  **VBA Lives is dedicated to you getting the most out of your Microsoft Applications and to help improve your job perfomance with the help of a little code.**  

There was a time in my life where I couldn't read or write a single bit of code.  I'd look at an integrated development environment (IDE) or code editor and not understand a single line of it.  **So this blog is very much written for the non-programmer.**  People in marketing, finance, sales, and small business owners will find value in this blog.  The only requirement is that you have basic familiarity with Excel and Access for each respective tutorial.

The tutorials are meant to provide a basic, logically ordered, and broad overview of VBA to deliver the most value in the shortest amount of time.  You won't become an overnight expert.  The goal is to give you the necesary knowledge upon which you can continue learning and growing in your code literacy, and hopefully gain productivity in your job.
