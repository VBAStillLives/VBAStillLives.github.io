### About this Blog

This blog was created to share my knowledge of the Microsoft Applications I work most with, and to provide basic VBA tutorials and examples. Anyone working in finance, marketing, sales, operations, analytics, or any job that entails the heavy use of Excel spreadshseets and other Microsoft Office Applications will find something of value in this blog. 

I want you to be empowered with full potential of the applications you use at your desk every single day to get the job done.  Learning a little bit of VBA will give you some serious productivity gains; letting you focus more of your valuable time on what makes you good at your actual job.  



### About Me

My name is Sevan Serafino, and I started off as management consultant that accidentally turned technologist in 2011.  Need is the mother of innovation, and this was the beginning of my journey with VBA.  I'd spend hours doing repetitive tasks in Excel to simply assemble my data before actually getting to the analysis that was the core accountability of my job.  VBA helped all that.  I started with a few snippets I found online at first (thank you [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com)).  Are this same time, I had the opportunity to learn the more advanced capabilities of VBA from a consulting vendor I worked with.  I was hooked from there, and the rest is history.  I've been employed as a business-facing rapid-prototyping developer for operations, strategic account management, finance, and analytics teams ever since.  

When I'm not coding VBA or doing data analysis, I'm a proud dad, ocean addict, amateur chef, and professional Netflix binge watcher.
