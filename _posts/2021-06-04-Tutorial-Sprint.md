I wanted to provide a quick update for anyone reading the blog at this point in time.  In these early stages of this blog's existence, the first thing I want to prioritize is setting up the basic tutorials for both Excel, and especially Access, VBA.  The *"especially"* for Access VBA is well deserved with there being little in the way of Access and its particular VBA objects relative to Excel (VBA). 

The actual posts of this will be mostly filled with what I hope are interesting and advanced code snippets as well some current-event pieces on the happenings of VBA in the greater Office ecosystem.  The posts of this blog will get more attention both in terms of content and frequency of posting once I've completed the tutorials.  The tutorials are what may help someone that needs a simple and linear path to explain VBA in an order that makes the most sense, so I'll be prioritizing the completion of those in the coming weeks with very little in the way of posts as you'd see in a traditional blog. 

Stay tuned for updates as I complete different modules of the tutorials.
