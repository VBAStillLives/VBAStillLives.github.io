How do you define "literacy" in the 21st century?  There was a time in human history where reading and writing your spoken tongue was rare.  Reading and writing is now common place.  Now that computers and mobile devices are common place, should we consider our ability to communicate with our devices and software programs as part of the definition of literacy?  I'm not referring to the annoying hashtag #learntocode.  I'm simply positing knowing some code, or knowing software's capabilities can help you in life in the same way that reading and writing can. 

When I first started learning how to script in VBA, I wasn't just learning the language itself.  I was learning how to organize data, how to organize my business process, data inputs, data outputs, and variables for deliberately.  I began to understand what software developers needed when I'd speak with someone I was working with on an 3rd party software implementation project, or if I had to ever speak with corporate IT. And just learning what software was capable of and *how* to do it (even if I didn't know the code per se to get it done) helped me differentiate and take on more responsibility in organizations that I've worked for. 

Increasing your tech literacy goes beyond your ability to write or understand code.  It gives you a new medium of communication that will expand your overall organizational effectiveness that can serve you well throughout your career.
