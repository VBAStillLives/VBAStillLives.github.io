I've been adding content to the [Excel VBA tutorial](/Excel-VBA-Tutorial/) page.  Whenever I add code samples to the tutorial, I'll add them here in the blog as well.  This first program called "Hello World" is a very simple one that is intended to teach beginners how to create and execute a software program. 

You can navigate directly to the tutorial [Hello World](/tutorial/excel/hello-world-excel-vba/) if you'd like to read up on the lesson in more detail.

You can also [download the workbook](/assets/files/HelloWorld_FirstProgram.xlsm) that contains the "Hello World" macro as well. 

Enjoy!
