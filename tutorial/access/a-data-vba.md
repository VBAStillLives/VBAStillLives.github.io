**Access VBA - Working with data**

For the purposes of this tutorial, we will cover how to work with data in Access VBA using two methods.  These two methods should cover the fast majority, if not all of your needs. 

The two methods we can process data in Access using VBA are: 

1. [Recordsets](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/recordset-object-dao)
2. SQL

**Recordsets**

You can get a more in depth definition of what a recordset is [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/office/client-developer/access/desktop-database-reference/recordset-object-dao).  Put simply, a recordset can be thought of as a virtual spreadsheet.  It allows you to query data with SQL, store it in a variable, and process it in the same way you might run through data in a loop using VBA in Excel.
