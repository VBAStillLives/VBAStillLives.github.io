The first thing you've got to do is set up your VBA development environment.  This page will show you how to do exactly that.    

Let's do a quick orientation on the VBA development enviornment.  

* Where do you write VBA code? 
	* As far as VBA is concerned, you **write code in what is called an Integrated Development Environment, known as IDE for short.**

* How is my code organized? 
	* **Modules**
		* **You will most frequently be writing code in modules.**  Modules are kind of like files, but for code.  The majority of your executable code will be written and executed from here. 
	* **Userforms**
		* Next on the list are userforms.  You might not know it, but you interact with userforms all the time.  Websites are essentially userforms that pull from a back-end database.  Your desktop calculator is a userform-based application.  These can come in handy when you are tasked with creating forms for people data entry. 
	* **Class modules**
		* These are way more advanced and are used primarily for object oriented programming.  We won't be touching on these in this tutorial. 

Now we will be setting up the development environment and covering how to navigate to your IDE, make a much needed configurations, and creating your first module.
